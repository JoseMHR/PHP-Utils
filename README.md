Notes:

The aim of these projects uploaded to github, are only instructional, wants to acquire experience, learn, and also show the code publicly to others people in case some piece of code helps you because they want to do something similar.

Some of them are made without any help or resources (like AnimalSounds or VisualAdventure), others may contain modified pieces of some tutorial or other github projects (like destroyAll, that have somes pieces of code about a tutorial of AndEngine).
